/**
 * media_entity_init - Initialize a media entity
 *
 * @num_pads: Total number of input and output pads.
 * @extra_links: Initial estimate of the number of extra links.
 * @pads: Array of 'num_pads' pads.
 *
 * The total number of pads is an intrinsic property of entities known by the
 * entity driver, while the total number of links depends on hardware design
 * and is an extrinsic property unknown to the entity driver. However, in most
 * use cases the entity driver can guess the number of links which can safely
 * be assumed to be equal to or larger than the number of pads.
 *
 * For those reasons the links array can be preallocated based on the entity
 * driver guess and will be reallocated later if extra links need to be
 * created.
 *
 * This function allocates a links array with enough space to hold at least
 * 'num_pads' + 'extra_links' elements. The media_entity::max_links field will
 * be set to the number of allocated elements.
 *
 * The pads array is managed by the entity driver and passed to
 * media_entity_init() where its pointer will be stored in the entity structure.
